		Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as credit card data),

		You can verify this by looking for a closed lock icon at the bottom of your web browser,
		or looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the web page.

		While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,
		we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information
		to perform a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted

		we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.
